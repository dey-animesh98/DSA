// Best case (Already sorted) TC- O(n) total (n-1) comparions
// Wrost case (Oppostie oreder sorted) - O(n^2)
//Why Insertion Sort
//Adaptive- number of swaps reduce if sorted(as compare to bubble sort)
// Insertion Sort is Stable sorting Because the original order is maintained for duplicated values
//Works well when array is partially sorted
// its takes part hybrid sorting algorithm=> (combining of multiple sort algorithms)
