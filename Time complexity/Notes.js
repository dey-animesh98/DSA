/**
 * Time Complexity != Time Taken
 * How time is grow as the input grows is time complexity.
 * 
 * Why we consider Wrost case to calculate complexity?
 * If the input grows then complexity will grow and in large amount of data more chance to algorithm fail to exceute.
 * so for this we always took worst case scenarioes.
 * because wrost case scenarioes handled then best scenarios will work easily. 
 * 
 * 
 * Why we ignore constants in time complexity?
 * Actual time taken varie from Machine to machine. We don't care about actual time. We need on relationship between time and input.
 * Even though the constant give the correct time but we ingore it constant has less significance, we only care about the relationship.

/**

 * e.g- in Fibanocci num if input is 4 [F(4)] - then height or path is 4[F(4)=>F(3)=>f(2)=>F(1)]. 
 * Space complexity - O(4n) ~ O(n)
