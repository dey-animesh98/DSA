// Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

// If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

// The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

// Input: nums = [1,2,3]
// Output: [1,3,2]

/** Intuition:-
 *  * we need to find the direct bigger number than the given one - example 13542 -> 14235 & 15234 both are the next permutations but 
 *  * 14235 is the closestnext permutation
 *  Steps:- 
 * 1. start from end and linearly search for an index where the a[i]< a[i+1] Why?   |i = 1|
 *   * we need the closest permutation -> 13542 -> i =1  => a[i]=3,  542 is the biggest number in the combination of 5,4,2
 *   * so we need a number which can be swapped with this combo to make an even bigger number -> 3 can be swapped with 4 or 5 
 * 2. find an index j such that a[j] > a[i] => a[j] can be 4,5 but 4 we choose 4 bcz we need the closest permutaion  |j=3|
 * 3. Swap i,j => 14532 , if we have chosen 5 => 15432> 14532 & is not the closest to 13542   => after swap =>|output = 14532|
 * 4. after 4 we want the smallest number possible => it shiuld be the incresing order of the next numbers=> 235 
 *   * which is reverse of the numbers 532
 *   * reverse the next elements after index i=> i+1 to last
